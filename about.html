    <h1 class="abouth1">HI!</h1>
    <p class="p-about">I'm an aspiring UX developer with an eye for detail and passion for quality. 
		When I'm not studying at Chas Academy or working on my own projects, you'll find me 
		gaming with some music in my headphones and my cat Alice on my lap.<br>
		The love for programming is something I've recently started to pursue, but my interest
		in design has been with me for a long time. As a previous lash artist I had to spend
		a lot of time and effort in perfecting my craft and eye for detail. This led me to 
		the very top of the lash world as a swedish champion in the master category of lash design.
		I'm not afraid to work hard, and I always want to learn more and push my craft.
